## Init Git
Git: version control

ctrl+j will open the terminal in vs code
the U next to file name means it is not being tracked
the M means a change has been made

## git work flow 
git init (only do once)
git add <filename>
git commit -m "<message>"
git log => gives info on the changes made
got status => status of the files + changes saved/unsaved

## create branch and switch
git branch <name>
git switch <name>

git log => display the commits
git status => status of current folder
git branch => show branches

prepend <word> append

## Convention of making changes
add
modify
remove
change

NO past tenses like added


if "." prepended to a file/folder it is a hidden folder
NEVER work from main branch
